                    <h2>About Us</h2>

                    <p class="about-text">
                        We are a nonprofit, community based Iranian Australian organisation in Melbourne, united by a
                        shared commitment to uplift, support, and empower people of Iranian heritage and the broader
                        Australian community. Guided by the timeless Persian values of human dignity, fairness, and
                        mutual respect, and proudly embracing Australia's core principles of the fair go, equality
                        before the law, freedom of speech, and the right of every individual to live in safety, we work
                        to build a stronger, more inclusive future while honouring our rich heritage.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-text">
                        As members of Australian society, we are deeply committed to the safety and security of our
                        country. We recognise the real danger posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its operatives
                        inside Australia and around the world. These networks threaten the peace, freedom, and
                        multicultural harmony that make Australia the safe and welcoming nation we all cherish.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-text">
                        That is why we actively stand against the influence of the Islamic Republic and its operatives
                        on Australian soil. By raising awareness, fostering unity across communities, and working
                        collaboratively with like minded groups, we strive to see these dangerous networks removed, not
                        only from Australia but from free societies worldwide. A world free of the Islamic Republic's
                        operatives is a safer Australia and a safer world.

                            <li>Organising cultural and educational events, Persian festival stalls, and community
                                gatherings that celebrate our heritage while promoting unity, integration, and cultural
                                awareness among all Australians.</li>

                            <li>Running information booths in collaboration with the global 100 Cities for Iran
                                initiative at <a href="https://100cities.org/">100cities.org</a> to amplify the message
                                of His Imperial Highness Crown Prince
                                Reza Pahlavi and to combat antisemitism and all forms of hate in Australia.</li>

                            <li>Partnering with other Iranian Australian and allied organisations on advocacy campaigns
                                that highlight human rights, women's rights, and the need for democratic change in Iran.
                            </li>

                            <li>Supporting the recent designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a
                                state sponsor of terrorism in Australia, and advocating for continued enforcement
                                against IRGC activities, consistent with actions already taken by the United States,
                                Canada, and other democratic nations.</li>

                        We proudly and unequivocally support His Imperial Highness Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi as the
                        legitimate opposition leader against the Islamic Republic regime. We believe his vision reflects
                        the true aspirations of the Iranian people for freedom, secular democracy, human rights, human
                        dignity, and the restoration of Iran's national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We adopt
                        his principles and code of conduct as the moral and practical framework for everything we do.

                    <p class="about-text">
                        By living these values here in Melbourne and across Australia, we strengthen our local
